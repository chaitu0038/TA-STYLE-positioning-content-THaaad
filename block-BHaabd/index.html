In our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms, our farms, barns and rickyards, in our docks, our granaries, our ships and our wharves, in our corn markkets, meat markets and other places too rumerous to mention, how useful they are in our ships,however, the rats oft set them at defiance: still they are of great service.
